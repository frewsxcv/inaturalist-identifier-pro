# Authentication System Changelog

## Overview

The authentication system in iNaturalist Pro has been redesigned to provide a better user experience by making login **optional at startup**. Users can now start using the app immediately and authenticate only when needed for specific features.

## Release Date

January 2025

---

## What Changed

### Before (Old Behavior)

- **Blocking Authentication**: The app would block on startup, forcing OAuth authentication before the UI appeared
- **Mandatory Login**: Users had to authenticate even if they only wanted to browse public data
- **Poor Error Handling**: If authentication failed, the app couldn't start
- **No Flexibility**: No way to use the app without an iNaturalist account

### After (New Behavior)

- **Non-blocking Startup**: The app launches immediately without waiting for authentication
- **Optional Login**: Users can browse public data without logging in
- **Dynamic Authentication**: Login button available in the UI when authentication is needed
- **Graceful Token Loading**: Saved tokens are loaded automatically if valid, but startup continues if none exists
- **Better UX**: Profile button/icon shows authentication status in the top-right corner

---

## User-Facing Changes

### New UI Elements

1. **Login Button** (ðŸ”’ Login)
   - Located in the top-right corner of the window
   - Visible when user is not authenticated
   - Clicking opens a login modal with OAuth instructions

2. **Profile Menu** (ðŸ‘¤ Profile)
   - Replaces login button when user is authenticated
   - Shows "âœ… Logged in" status
   - Contains account options (coming soon)
   - Includes logout option (coming soon)

3. **Login Modal**
   - Clean dialog explaining the OAuth process
   - "Login" and "Cancel" buttons
   - Status messages for authentication progress
   - User-friendly error messages

### Features Available Without Login

âœ… Browse observations
âœ… View observation details and photos
âœ… View computer vision suggestions
âœ… Explore taxonomic hierarchies
âœ… Search for users
âœ… View user profiles
âœ… Navigate between all app views

### Features Requiring Login

ðŸ”’ Submitting new observations (future)
ðŸ”’ Managing personal data (future)

## Technical Changes

### Modified Files

#### `main.rs`
- Removed blocking OAuth call at startup
- Changed token loading to be non-blocking
- Token check now only validates expiration, doesn't require authentication
- Actors initialized with empty string tokens if no authentication
- App receives client credentials for dynamic authentication
- Added `AuthenticationComplete` and `AuthenticationFailed` messages

#### `app.rs`
- Added `api_token: Option<String>` field to App struct
- Added `client_id` and `client_secret` fields for dynamic authentication
- Made `AppState` and its fields public for external access
- Added `is_authenticated`, `show_login_modal`, and `auth_status_message` to AppState
- Implemented `show_login_modal()` method
- Implemented `initiate_login()` method with background authentication
- Refactored message processing to handle auth messages
- Removed MessageHandler struct (simplified inline)
- Updated `process_messages()` to handle authentication state changes

#### `panels/top_panel.rs`
- Complete redesign to support authentication UI
- Added profile/login button to menu bar
- Implemented `show_authenticated_menu()` for logged-in users
- Implemented `show_login_button()` for non-authenticated users
- Right-aligned authentication controls in menu bar
- Status message display for authentication feedback

#### Documentation Updates
- `USER_GUIDE.md`: Added comprehensive Authentication section
- `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`: Added authentication troubleshooting section
- `README.md`: Updated features section with authentication info

### New Message Types

```rust
pub enum AppMessage {
    // ... existing messages ...
    AuthenticationComplete(String),  // Contains API token
    AuthenticationFailed(String),    // Contains error message
}
```

### Actor Changes

- All actors now accept empty strings for `api_token` at initialization
- Actors will use the token if available, or fail gracefully if features require auth
- No breaking changes to actor interfaces

## Benefits

### For Users

1. **Faster Startup**: No waiting for OAuth browser windows or authentication
2. **Try Before Login**: Explore the app without creating an account
3. **Better Privacy**: Only authenticate when necessary
4. **Clearer Requirements**: Visual indicators show when login is needed
5. **Persistent Sessions**: Valid tokens automatically loaded on subsequent launches

### For Developers

1. **Better Error Handling**: Authentication failures don't crash the app
2. **More Flexible**: Easier to test without authentication
3. **Cleaner Architecture**: Separation of concerns between auth and app logic
4. **Better UX**: Users see the UI immediately, increasing engagement

## Implementation Details

### Token Management

- **Storage Location**: `~/.config/inaturalist-identifier-pro/` (Linux/macOS) or `%APPDATA%\inaturalist-identifier-pro\` (Windows)
- **Format**: Configuration file managed by `confy` crate
- **Security**: Token stored locally, transmitted only to iNaturalist API
- **Lifetime**: Tokens checked for expiration on startup

### Authentication Flow

1. User clicks "ðŸ”’ Login" button
2. Login modal appears with instructions
3. User clicks "Login" in modal
4. Background task spawns to handle OAuth:
   - Creates new `Authenticator` instance
   - Calls `get_api_token()` (opens browser)
   - User authenticates in browser
   - Token received and saved to config
5. `AuthenticationComplete` message sent to app
6. UI updates to show "ðŸ‘¤ Profile" button
7. App state updated with token and auth status

### Error Handling

- Network errors: Displayed in modal with retry option
- Browser issues: Instructions provided to user
- Token expiration: Automatic re-authentication prompt
- Invalid credentials: Error message with support info

---

## Breaking Changes

**None**. This update is fully backward compatible. Existing saved tokens will continue to work.

---

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Implement logout functionality
- [ ] Display user account information in Profile menu
- [ ] Add "Remember Me" option
- [ ] Support multiple accounts
- [ ] Token refresh mechanism
- [ ] Authentication status in status bar

---

## Migration Guide

No migration required! The app will automatically:
- Load existing tokens if they're valid
- Continue working if no token exists
- Prompt for login only when needed

Users with existing tokens will see "ðŸ‘¤ Profile" immediately on startup, indicating they're already logged in.
